# Urban mobility harmonized data models

These data models represent generic entities involve in urban mobility. These data models have been defined without imposing linking requirements. This way they can be used either in a standalone manner or linked, even with external GTFS feed files.

When feasible, references to existing schema.org entity types and attributes are included.

The main entities identified are:

+ [ArrivalEstimation](../ArrivalEstimation/doc/spec.md). Generic arrival estimation or a public transport to a stop.
+ [GtfsTransitFeedFile](../GtfsTransitFeedFile/doc/spec.md). Pointer to an external GTFS feed file.
